 """
    A global abstract class representing a caching provider which can be used
    to lookup the JSON responses to the most recently or most frequently issued
    OWM Weather API requests.
    The purpose of the caching mechanism is to avoid OWM Weather API requests and
    therefore network traffic: the implementations should be adapted to the
    time/memory requirements of the OWM data clients (i.e: a "slimmer" cache
    with lower lookup times but higher miss rates or a "fatter" cache with
    higher memory consumption and higher hit rates?).
    Subclasses should implement a proper caching algorithms bearing in mind
    that different weather data types may have different change rates: in
    example, observed weather can change very frequently while long-period
    weather forecasts change less frequently.
    External caching mechanisms (eg: memcached, redis, etc..) can be used by
    extending this class into a proper decorator for the correspondent Python
    bindings.
